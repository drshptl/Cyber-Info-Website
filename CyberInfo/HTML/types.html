   <center><h1><p id="head1">Main Types of Cyber  crime</p></h1></center> 
    <h3><p id="head2">Against Individual</p></h3>
	  
    <p id="typed" >The content in websites and other electronic communications may be distasteful, obscene or offensive for a variety of reasons. In some cases these communications may be illegal. Around 25 jurisdictions place limits on certain speech and ban racist, blasphemous, politically subversive, libelous or slanderous, seditious, or inflammatory material that tends to incite hate crimes. The extent of these unlawful communications varies greatly between countries, and even within nations. It is a sensitive case in which the courts can become involved in arbitrating between groups with strong beliefs. One part of Internet pornography that has been the target of the strongest efforts at curtailment is child pornography. Whereas the content may be offensive in a non-specific way, harassment directs obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals focusing for example on gender, race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation. This often occurs in chat rooms, through newsgroups, and by sending hate e-mail to interested parties. Any comment that may be found disrespectful or offensive is considered harassment. </p>
	  
	  <h3><p id="head2">Against Individual Property</p></h3>
	  
    <p id="typed" >Electronic funds transfer systems have begun to increase, and so has the risk that such transactions may be taken into hold and diverted. Valid credit card numbers can be easily intercepted electronically, as well as physically; the digital information stored on a card can be recreated. In 1994, a Russian hacker, Vladimir Levin, operating from St Petersburg, retrieved the computers of Citibank's central wire transfer department, and transferred funds from large corporate accounts to other accounts which had been opened by his subordinates in The United States. The above form of computer-related crime is not inevitably mutually exclusive, and need not occur in isolation. One robs telecommunications services and uses them for aimed vandalism, fraud, or in furtherance of a criminal conspiracy. Computer-related crime may be intensive in nature, combining two or more of the general forms. </p>
	  
	   <h3><p id="head2">Against Society</p></h3>
	  
    <p id="typed" >Cyber-bullying is the harmful use of the Internet and related technologies to harm other people, in a deliberate, repeated, and hostile manner. As it has become more often in society, particularly among young people, legislation and awareness campaigns have arisen to combat it. Cyber-bullying has subsequently been defined as "when the Internet, cell phones or other devices are used to send or post text or images for a particular purpose to hurt or embarrass another person". Cyber-bullying can be as simple as continuing to send e-mail to someone who has said they want no further contact with the sender, but it may also include threats, sexual remarks, pejorative labels , ganging up on victims by making them the subject of ridicule in forums, and posting false statements as fact aimed at humiliation. Cyber-stalking is the use of the Internet or other electronic means to stalk an individual, a group of individuals, or an organization. It may include false accusations, making threats, identity theft, and damage to data or equipment, the solicitation of minors for sex, or gathering information in order to harass. The definition of "harassment" must meet the criterion that a reasonable person, in possession of similar information, would regard it as sufficient to cause another reasonable person distress. Cyber stalking is different from spatial stalking. However, it sometimes leads to it, or is accompanied by it. The practice of cyber bullying is not limited to children, while the behavior is identified by the same definition in adults; the distinction in age groups is sometimes referred to as cyber stalking or cyber harassment when perpetrated by adults toward adults, sometimes directed on the basis of sex. Common tricks used by cyber stalkers are to vandalize a search engine or encyclopedia, to threaten a victim's earnings, employment, reputation, or safety. Repetition of such actions against a target by an adult constitutes cyber stalking. </p>
	  
	  
	   <h3><p id="head2">Against Private Organizations</p></h3>
	  
    <p id="typed" >Digital technology permits perfect reproduction and has simplified the dissemination of print, graphics, sound, and multimedia combinations. The temptation to reproduce copyrighted material for personal purpose, for sale at a lower price, or indeed, for free distribution, has proven irresistible to many. This piracy has caused considerable concern to owners of copyrighted material. The Software Publishers Association has computed that approximately $7.4 billion worth of software was lost to piracy in 1993 with $2 billion of that being stolen from the Internet. It was found that, a copy of the most recent James Bond Film “The World is not enough” was available free on the internet before its official release. When creators of a work, are unable to profit from their creations, there can be a chilling effect on creative effort generally, in addition to financial loss. </p>
	  
	  <h3><p id="head2">Against Government/ nation</p></h3>
	  
    <p id="typed" >As never before, western industrialized society is interdependent upon complex data processing and telecommunications systems. Any damage to, or interference with, any of these systems can lead to harmful consequences. Whether incited by curiosity or vindictiveness electronic intruders cause disoblige at best, and have the potential for inflicting massive harm. While this potential has yet to be cognized, a number of individuals and protest groups have hacked the official web pages of various governmental and commercial organizations. Defense planners around the world are considerably investing in information warfare-- means of interrupting the information technology infrastructure of defense systems. Attempts were made to interrupt the computer systems of the Sri Lankan Government and of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at the time of 1999 bombing of Belgrade. Recently, an extortionist in Eastern Europe acquired the credit card details of customers of a North American based on-line music retailer, and published some on the Internet when the retailer refused to accept his demands.<br><br> Government officials and Information Technology refuge specialists have acknowledged a significant rise in Internet problems and server scans since early 2001. But there is a growing apprehension among central officials that such intrusions are part of a well thought-out effort by cyber terrorists, foreign intelligence services, or other groups to map potential security holes in critical systems. A cyber terrorist is someone who intimidates or coerces a government or organization to continue his or her political or social objectives by introducing computer-based attack against computers, network, and the information stored on them. Cyber terrorism in general, may be defined as an act of terrorism which has taken place through the use of cyberspace or computer resources. For example, a simple misinformation in the Internet, that there will be bomb attacks during the holidays can be considered as cyber terrorism. As well there are also hacking activities intended towards individuals, families, organized by groups within networks, tending to cause terror among people, demonstrate power, collecting appropriate information for ruining peoples' lives, robberies, blackmailing etc. Cyber extortion is a type of cyber terrorism in which a website, e-mail server, or computer system is subjected to repetitive rejection of service or other attacks by wicked hackers, who demand money in return for promising to stop the attacks. Fearing that such attacks may become the custom in future warfare among nation-states, the concept of cyberspace operations impacts and will be adapted by war fighting military commanders in the future me out of the domain. Perpetrators characteristically use a scattered denial-of-service attack. </p>
